# 🏥 Healthcare Cost Prediction

## 📖 Overview
This project aims to predict healthcare costs using a dataset containing information about various individuals and their associated healthcare expenses. By applying machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes features such as age, gender, and medical history to forecast future healthcare costs for new data inputs, aiding in financial planning and resource allocation in healthcare.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict healthcare costs based on individual characteristics.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzes the dataset to identify key factors influencing healthcare expenses.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an easy way to input new data and receive cost predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
The project includes a dataset that contains information about individuals, including their demographics and healthcare costs. This dataset is essential for training and testing the prediction model.

### Dataset File
- `insurance.csv`: Contains features such as age, gender, medical history, and corresponding healthcare costs.
